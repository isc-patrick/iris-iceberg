Info gathering (From generla to to specific)
     - Raise your hand if you have worked with:
       - data warehouse? 
       - A data lake?
       - Hadoop 
         - Spark
         - Hive 
  
  Leading questions, prefereably with answers from the crowd
    - Who here has tried to use cloud blob storage like a standard file system? Anyone with a very large set of objects? things like mountpoint-s3?
    - It might be cool to show an actual demo of running ls on a bucket with 10000's objects and see what is happening - would be really cool visually to see how netwrok delays with detached storaged are the primary driving force of new table formats
